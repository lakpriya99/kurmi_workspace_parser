# Kurmi Vendor Filter

## Purpose

After extracting workspace files with `kurmi_workspace_parser.py`, use this script to filter and remove unwanted vendor directories from the `kurmi_workspace_extraction/` folder.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

**Step 1: Extract workspace first**
```bash
python3 kurmi_workspace_parser.py
```

**Step 2: Filter vendors**
```bash
python3 kurmi_vendor_filter.py
```

---

## üìù What It Does

1. **Scans** category folders (service_definitions, quickfeatures, etc.)
2. **Identifies** all vendor subdirectories in each category
3. **Displays** vendor distribution across categories
4. **Allows interactive selection** of vendors to keep
5. **Removes** all non-selected vendor directories

**Note:** The `scenarios/` directory is excluded from vendor scanning and filtering to preserve all scenario files.

**Use Cisco preset (recommended for Cisco on-premises deployments):**
```
Your choice: cisco
Your choice: done
```
This selects: Allocations, Cisco, Directory, ForgottenPassword, Technical, User, WrongAttempt, common, licensing

-v, --verbose      Enable verbose logging
-h, --help         Show help message
```

### Usage Examples:

**Standard usage:**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Before Running:
1. ‚úÖ **Run `kurmi_workspace_parser.py` first** to extract the workspace
2. ‚úÖ Ensure `kurmi_workspace_extraction/` directory exists
3. ‚úÖ **Make a backup** if you want to preserve the original extraction

### Safety Features:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Confirms before removing vendors
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Shows which vendors will be removed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Allows cancellation at any time (type `q`)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Logs all operations to `vendor_filter.log`

### Caution:
- ‚ùå **This operation CANNOT be undone**
- ‚ùå Removed vendor directories are permanently deleted
- ‚ùå Re-run the parser to restore removed vendors

---

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- No external dependencies (uses standard library only)
- Must have extracted workspace in `kurmi_workspace_extraction/` directory

---

## üìù Logging

The script creates a log file: `vendor_filter.log` in the current directory with detailed execution information.

---

## üéØ Complete Workflow

**Full workflow for parsing and filtering:**

```bash
# Step 1: Parse workspace and extract all files
python3 kurmi_workspace_parser.py

# Step 2: Filter vendors (keep only what you need)
python3 kurmi_vendor_filter.py

# Result: Clean extraction with only selected vendors
```

## üìä Statistics

After completion, you'll see statistics like:

```
============================================================
